        <p>The <em>horse</em> is awesome because <strong> a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. </strong>.Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. <br>Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.<br>Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. <br>Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.</p>
